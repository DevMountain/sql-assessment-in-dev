# SQL-Assessment
----

## Setup

  1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
  2. Look over the files included in this assessment.
    - You should notice that you already have a node server set up for you.
    - **NOTE: Do *not* change the port. The Postman tests will only work on port `3000`.**
  3. Create a database called `assessbox` on your postgres server.
  4. In `server.js`:

  a. Connect to the `assessbox` database using `massive.js`.

  b.  After database connection, use `app.set()` to set, or store, your database connection as a key/value pair. Example:
  ```
  app.set('db', myDatabaseConnection);
  ```
  c. Export `app`. Example:
  ```
  const app = module.exports = express();
  ```
  5. In `mainCtrl.js`:

  a. At the top of the file, require the `server.js` file, use the constant `app`. Use `app.get()` to retrieve database connection that was previously set.
  ```
  const app = require('/path/to/server/file');
  const db = app.get('db');
  ```
### Users
  Using the `user_create_seed.sql` file

  Create a table called `users` with columns for `id` (auto incrementing primary key), `name`, and `email`;

  Insert 3 records using the following data:
  ```
  John Smith   -   Email: john@smith.com
  Dave Davis   -   Email: dave@davis.com
  Jan Janis    -   Email: jane@janis.com
  ```
### Vehicles
  Using the `vehicle_create_seed.sql` file

  Create a table called `vehicles` with columns for `id` (auto incrementing primary key), `make`, `model`, `year`, and `owner_id` (a foreign key to `users`)

  Insert 6 records into vehicles using the following data:
  ```
  1991 Toyota Camry  -   Owner: John Smith
  1995 Honda Civic   -   Owner: John Smith
  2005 Ford Focus    -   Owner: John Smith
  2003 Ford Taurus   -   Owner: Dave Davis
  2010 VW Bug        -   Owner: Dave Davis
  2013 Mini Coup     -   Owner: Jane Janis
  ```

## Import Postman tests

######  A file named `sql_assessment.postman_collection.json` is inside the `postman_testing` folder. We will import this file in postman.

  1. Open Postman.
  2. In the top left corner, click on the `Import` button.

      ![Import button](images/import_btn.png?raw=true "Import button")

  3. Make sure that ```Import File``` is selected / underlined, then click on ```Choose Files```.

      - You will need to select the ```sql_assessment.postman_collection.json``` file (located in the ```postman_testing``` folder of this repo).

## Running individual tests

  1. As you create each endpoint, you can (and should) test the endpoint.
      - Click on ```Collections``` on the left panel.
      - Expand the collection of tests by clicking on the ```sql_assessment``` collection.

      **NOTE:** Each test name has a number after it that corresponds to a specific endpoint, which are numbered in the instructions. The endpoints may have multiple corresponding tests.

      - Click on the test you want to run. Click on the blue ```Send``` button. The tests will automatically run when you send the request.
      - Select ```Tests``` to see what tests passed/failed.

        ![Tests tab](images/tests_tab.png?raw=true "Tests tab")

      **NOTE:** You need to be running ```nodemon``` in order to successfully run the Postman tests.

      **IMPORTANT:** The Postman tests manipulate some of the user data. Before you run the Postman tests, you should restart nodemon. You can do this in the terminal while nodemon is running by typing ```rs``` and then pressing `enter`.  

## Endpoints & Queries

GOTCHA: It's important to know that express converts values passed into and accessed off of 'params' into strings. This might not match the data types you set in your schema and will result in errors if they don't.


**HINT:** You may need to use the `RETURNING` clause, which causes an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement to compute and return a value based on what was inserted, updated, or deleted. Example:
```
DELETE FROM cookies_table
WHERE cookie_name = 'raisin'
RETURNING *;
```

<br>
1. Create an endpoint at ``GET /api/users`` that will query the database and get all users.

2. Create an endpoint at `GET '/api/vehicles'` that will query the database and get all vehicles.

3. Create an endpoint at `POST '/api/users'` that will take a user from the body and add them to the database.
  * Use the  `RETURNING` clause to return the added user information.

4. Create an endpoint at `POST '/api/vehicles'` that will take a vehicle from the body and add it to the database.
  * Use the  `RETURNING` clause to return the added vehicle information.

5. Create an endpoint at `GET '/api/user/:userId/vehiclecount'` that will return a count of how many vehicles belong to the given user.
 * Response should be an object with a count property, ie: `{ count: 1 }`

6. Create an endpoint at `GET '/api/user/:userId/vehicle'` that will find all vehicles that belong to the user with the provided users id.

7. Create an endpoint at `GET '/api/vehicle'` that will find all vehicles that belong to the user with the provided user's email.
  * The users email will be send on the request url as a **query**. Example: `?userEmail=[user email]`

8. Use the *above* endpoint to also handle the query `?userFirstStart=[letters]` to get all vehicles for any user whose first name starts with the provided letters.

9. Create an endpoint at `GET '/api/newervehiclesbyyear'` that gets all vehicles newer than 2000 and sorted by year with the newest car first. Include the owner's name from the users table.

10. Create an endpoint at `PUT '/api/vehicle/:vehicleId/user/:userId'` that changes the ownership of the provided vehicle to be the new user.
  * Use the  `RETURNING` clause to return the updated vehicle information.

11. Create an endpoint at `DELETE '/api/user/:userId/vehicle/:vehicleId'` that removes ownership of that vehicle from the provided user, but does not delete the vehicle.
  * Use the  `RETURNING` clause to return the updated vehicle information.

12. Create an endpoint at `DELETE '/api/vehicle/:vehicleId'` that deletes the specified vehicle.
  * Use the  `RETURNING` clause to return the removed vehicle information.

## Running the test collection

######  To pass the assessment, you need to run the collection and have all tests pass.

1. Select ```Collections``` on the left panel of Postman (next to History).
2. Next to the ```sql_assessment``` collection, click on the right arrow.

    ![right arrow](images/right_arrow.png?raw=true "right arrow")

3. Select the blue ```Run``` button. This will open up the collection runner.

    ![run button](images/run_btn.png?raw=true "run button")

4. When you are ready to run the tests, select the blue ```Start Test``` button at the bottom. When all tests have passed, show your mentor.

    **NOTE:** You need to be running ```nodemon``` in order to successfully run the Postman tests.

    **IMPORTANT:** The Postman tests manipulate some of the user data. Before you run the Postman tests, you should restart nodemon. You can do this in the terminal while nodemon is running by typing ```rs``` and then pressing ```enter```.

##### When all 17 tests are passing, show your mentor.
